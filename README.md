# SmartGarden

## Description
The SmartGarden project is an intelligent device for plant care that is based on the Raspberry Pi and equipped with various sensors. Its specific functions are as follows:

* Automatically watering plants based on soil moisture
* Real-time adjustment of light intensity based on indoor brightness
* Real-time monitoring with a camera and alert activation when insects are detected
* UDP transmission of Pi data to the local PC, which allows users to observe the data via a QT interface.  

This project is being completed for Real Time Embedded Programming 5 at the University of Glasgow by Yucheng Xiao, Anthony Jin, Cheng Cai and Shuhan Dai.
